## ❓What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)❓
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The goal is a computer capable of "understanding" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.

Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation.



## 💡facts💡


The name of the paper :  Malware Detection With NLP.


The feature: API call


The type of classifier: static:


## 💡 The Attack 💡

### Type of weak spots:
Adding features on the app that was classified as "malicious".

### The way to find the weakness:

A. First we opened the classifier and checked which files it works on.

B. We printed the names of the applications that the classifier took as "test" and those that he took as "training". (From this section we work on the applications that were taken for testing)

C. We found that the features are xml files that describe the API of the applications.

D. We looked for the weak spots of the features and changed the values of the features in the xml files.

E. After section D was unsuccessful, we took several features from an application that was classified as "benign" and put them into an application that was classified as "malicious".

F. After a considerable number of activations of the classifier after each change we were able to narrow the search range.

G. We found that a small number of features that we add to an application that is classified as "malicious" lowers the accuracy of the classifier.


### How you intend to exploit it:

A. We will add a code that checks which bad apps the classifier takes for "testing".

B.  Open the " malicious " application with Apktool. 

C. We will add to the Smali files - features from an application that has been classified as " benign " (you can also add other features that are not harmful to the application).

D. Close the " malicious " app after the changes with apktool

E. We will run the classifier on the application after the changes.
